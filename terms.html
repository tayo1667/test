            <h2>3. Cryptocurrency Savings Services</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Service Description</h3>
            <p>Sentriom provides cryptocurrency savings services that allow you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deposit supported cryptocurrencies into fixed-term savings plans</li>
                <li>Lock in cryptocurrency values at the time of deposit</li>
                <li>Earn guaranteed Annual Percentage Yield (APY) returns</li>
                <li>Choose from multiple savings plan durations (3, 6, or 12 months)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 Rate Lock Mechanism</h3>
            <p><strong>Critical Understanding:</strong> When you deposit cryptocurrency into a Sentriom savings plan, the USD value of your cryptocurrency is locked at the current market rate at the time of deposit. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your returns are calculated based on the locked USD value, not the cryptocurrency amount</li>
                <li>You are protected from cryptocurrency price volatility during the savings period</li>
                <li>At maturity, you receive your principal plus APY returns based on the locked value</li>
                <li>Market fluctuations during the savings period do not affect your guaranteed returns</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.3 Savings Plans and APY</h3>
            <p>We offer the following savings plans with guaranteed APY rates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3-Month Plan:</strong> 2.4% APY</li>
                <li><strong>6-Month Plan:</strong> 3.6% APY</li>
                <li><strong>12-Month Plan:</strong> 4.8% APY</li>
            </ul>
            <p>APY rates are subject to change for new deposits but remain fixed for existing deposits throughout their term.</p>

            <h3>3.4 Lock-In Period</h3>
            <p><strong>No Early Withdrawal:</strong> Deposits are locked for the entire duration of the selected savings plan. Early withdrawal is not permitted under any circumstances, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Market volatility or cryptocurrency price changes</li>
                <li>Personal financial emergencies</li>
                <li>Changes in regulatory environment</li>
                <li>Force majeure events</li>
            </ul>
